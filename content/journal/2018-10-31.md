## Open-Source

#### haskell-ide-engine

Refactored yesterday's [Make casesplit a HaRe action pull request](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/pull/917) so `casesplit` is still a valid `ghcmod` command.
Rebased [Refactor HaRe mkCodeActions](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/haskell-ide-engine/commit/bd01ab3021789847f5022937f017c2fb689aeb75) onto compatibility commits.

#### rg_replace
Worked the initial logic


note: I added a bold red error to my zshrc when I haven't made a journal entry for the day. Hopefuly it works.
