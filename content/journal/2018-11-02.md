#### rg_replace

I renamed `grep_json_reader` to [`grep_json_deserialize`](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/grep_json_deserialize).
I added serde (de)serialization, tests and a lossy UTF-8 view of the `ArbitraryData`.
`ArbitraryData` is an enum holding `base64` or `String` that `ripgrep` outputs to get around invalid UTF-8 file paths and text.

E.g. MacOS's APFS treats paths as a bag of bytes which may or may not be valid UTF-8.
E.g. `ripgrep` also suports seraches on binary data.
