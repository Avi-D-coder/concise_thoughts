## Started working on tolerant-ghc

#### The goals:

- Provide type and other info about Haskell code
- Buildup working subsets of code in the event of an error.
- Use solution strategies on top of working subsets to fix errors. E.g. replace error with `undefined`, change indent broken bit, import missing, qualify import, etc...
- The API should have a STM concurrent view of the most complete/type-checked info.
- The API should give immutable views of source and info, so you can easily test a refactor without having to manually revert if there are unsolvable errors or you don't use the refactor.

#### How to accomplish this:

- Learn the GHC API.
- Write the code.

## Learned:

- Read [haskell.org/GHC/As_a_library](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/As_a_library)
Looked at linked libraries:

    1. [plugins](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/plugins): Last commit almost a year ago open issue says it does not work with 7.6.3+
    2. [hint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint): Very cool, but focused on interpreting code rather than just type checking, but maybe it will work for my uses too.

### No-Go on hint

1. The [docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint) look good except for [Error handling](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint-0.9.0/docs/Language-Haskell-Interpreter.html#g:9).
   `MultipleInstancesNotAllowed` "The installed version of ghc is not thread-safe. This exception is thrown whenever you try to execute `runInterpreter` while another instance is already running."
   This could significantly slowdown solving with fix strategies. The There is a [github issue](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/68) about it.
   The gist that GHC used to not be thread safe and the linker is still not thread safe. On the bright side, someone is trying to fix it.
2. There is an open issue: [Offer way to retrieve GHC warnings](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/17), from 2016.

The hint library looks great if I needed an interpreter, but I just need a type-checker.
Since I just need an interpreter I am hoping the GHC APIs I need don't depend on the thread unsafe linker. We will see.

### Strategy Going Forward
Reading about the old GHC threading limitation and the still present GHC linker threading limitation shed some light on a possible reason [ghc-mod](https://github.com/DanielG/ghc-mod) subsequently [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) use a single thread for interacting with GHC [(souce)](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/blob/master/docs/Architecture.md).
Hopefully the issue won't affect this project, but if not I may have to multiplex the concurrent API onto a single thread until the linker will be fixed.
Avoid problems mentioned in haskell-ide-engine: [docs/Challenges.md](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/blob/master/docs/Challenges.md).
