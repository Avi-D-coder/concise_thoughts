## haskell-ide-engine

Apparently vim language server protocol implementations: [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp), [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) and [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) implement [`textDocument_didChange`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_didChange) by simply sending the whole file not the ranges that changed.
This broke [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)'s get type in presents of errors feature ([github issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/924)).
I use a vim plugin [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree); it uses a Vim 7 feature Undo branches to create a tree of changes.
This feature seems like it should allow the lsp implementations to only send changed ranges in `textDocument_didChange`.

## tolerant-ghc

Looking over the [GHC API](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc) I found `GhcLink` in [DynFlags](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.6.1/docs/DynFlags.html).
`GhcLink` has the constructor `NoLink`; if it does what it says it does we hit the jackpot.
Using the `GhcLink``NoLink` we should be able to avoid the thread unsafe GHC linker.
This means we should be able to test the products of fix strategies in parallel from the start no need for multiplexing onto as single ghc.
I still have to check this works, but this is a very good indicator.


## rg_replace

I handled the case where the user does not pass in needed flags to `ripgrep`.
