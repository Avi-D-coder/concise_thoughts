## rg_replace
I missed the summary enum variant, So I added it and a Test to [`grep_json_deserialize`](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/grep_json_deserialize/commit/bd90dacaeca98b63d77e35f1c664ef8bd8541083).
I also added an example of deserializing `ripgrep` output to the `README` and published the update to crates.io.
I implemented grouping `ripgrep` output by file, into a map of lines, so all we have to do is implement the writers (diff and direct/interactive) on a `FileGroup`.

## LanguageClient-neovim
Wile the using undotree's method might work it would still only get me changes once apon returning to normal mode. The [api-buffer-updates](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#api-buffer-updates) api will get me fined grained updates for neovim any way in insert mode.
