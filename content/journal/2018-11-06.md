## LanguageClient-neovim

In my quest to make the [`textDocument_didChange`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_didChange) implementation send just the changes in stead of the entire file, I have been reading the neovim API docs.
The docs of note are [api-buffer-updates](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#api-buffer-updates) and [channel-intro)](https://neovim.io/doc/user/channel.html#channel-intro).
I have also been looking into the [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) code-base.
The author had "- Register buffer modified notification instead of TextChanged autocmd" on his TODO list, but removed it in a commit titled ["The new buffer update API is not going to work as it limits to MessagePack-RPC plugins."](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim/commit/96079a7e267a70098e1833407afa60765bf8fa2e)

See, historically Vim plugins were written in VimL also known as Vimscript and were synchronous Neovim came along out of a disagreement as to how/when/if asynchronous plugins should be supported. Vim 8 introduced async to Vim, but Neovim also advocates for lua or RPC based plugins rather than large amounts of Vimscript.
`api-buffer-updates` seem to only be exposed to the RPC API and maybe the lua API I have not checked.
The API should be exposed to Vimscript via the [eval-api](https://neovim.io/doc/user/eval.html#eval-api), but it does not seem to be.
This is a problem, since despite being written in rust LanguageClient-neovim uses a Vimscript layer to interface with Vim/Neovim on stdin/stdout rather than the Neovim RPC API.

#### Solution in Theory

1. Make sure we have a Neovim with the buffer update API `has('nvim-0.3.0')`.
2. Then obtain the default socket found at `v:servername` as described in [rpc-connecting](https://neovim.io/doc/user/msgpack_rpc.html#rpc-connecting).
3. Use this socket with the rust crate [neovim-lib](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-lib) for our RPC needs.
4. Subscribe to updates with [`nvim_buf_attach()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_buf_attach()>), getting the whole buffer when we attach.
5. Store each line of the buffer in a `Vec<String>`.
6. When we get [`nvim_buf_lines_event`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#api-buffer-updates) diff the new lines with the old lines using using the `Vec` as an index.
7. Send the exact diff to language-servers in `textDocument_didChange` instead of the whole file with a null diff range.
8. Short circuit all the calls to `textDocument_didChange` LanguageClient-neovim uses to guaranty language-server have an up to date view of the file/buffer.

#### Solution in Practice

- Add `pub nvim_update_rpc_socket: Option<String>,` to the `State` struct in `LanguageClient-neovim/src/languageclient.rs`.
- Set `nvim_update_rpc_socket` to the result of the VimL expression `get(g:, 'LanguageClient_useNvimUpdateApi', 1) && has('nvim-0.3.0') ? get(v:,'servername', v:null) : v:null`.
  `get` translates to find the read the value of the globally scoped variable `LanguageClient_useNvimUpdateApi`.
  If `LanguageClient_useNvimUpdateApi` does not exist `get` will return `1`.
  VimL does not have booleans so 1 is used by convention to represent true (technically any integer other than `0` is treated as true).
  The buffer-updates API was introduced in Neovim 0.3.0, so we use `has` to ensure we can call the API.
  `?` `:` is just ternary notation like you would find in JavaScript.

- First Complication: There is a setting `g:LanguageClient_changeThrottle` which controls how often changes sent to the language server.
  Each time `textDocument_didChange` is called (when any request is made to the server) changes are sent and the last sync time is reset.
  If I respect `throttle` I will have to store changes for latter syncing that occur in before `throttle` expires or `textDocument_didChange` is called.
  I asked the author if adhering is necessary: [github issue](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim/issues/551).
  For now I will proceed without adhering.
