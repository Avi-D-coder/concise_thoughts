## LanguageClient-neovim
Worked on implementing what yesterdays plan.
Almost ruled out using diff with Vim to do incremental sync.
Even with a fast ugly diff algorithm it will not work.
It would result in too many diffs with a custom algorithm or bad performance with a LCS diff.
The one possibility is to do a LCS on each line as a sort of compromise.

I am already using a line index `Vec<String>` for Neovim.

## rg_replace
Worked on Formating a bit.
