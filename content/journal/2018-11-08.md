## LanguageClient-neovim

### Problem

Incrementally send Vim/Neovim buffer updates to lsp servers.
We get buffer updates in two the forms:

- Neovim's [nvim_buf_lines_event](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_buf_lines_event), which tells us what lines changed and their new contents.
- Vim: Vim has a non existent API so we can query the full contents of buffer and that's it.

We are attempting to send updates in the format of a list of changed UTF-16 ranges and the changed UTF-16 text.
We need to minimize the size and to a lesser extent the number of changes.

If we send change delta with false positives we may cause lsp servers to unnecessarily invalidate cached info.
As is the case with [Hover information stops working after saving a file](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/924)

### Solution: diff to the rescue!

We will just diff the buffer with the last version we saw and send the resulting delta!

Not so fast, when we talk about differencing a text we are talking about the [Longest common subsequence problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem).
Spoiler: due inherent time and memory complexity, running even an optimum diff algorithm on changes that can span a several thousand line buffer ever time search and replace is analogous to placing your laptop in the oven.

### Solution 2.0 dynamic programming

We need to minimize the length of the sequences we diff.
Neovim starts this for us by having the API report changed lines.

We will store the last buffer we saw split by line buffer.
We will hash each line and store the hash with the line.
The [murmur3 hash](https://docs.rs/fasthash/0.3.2/fasthash/murmur3/index.html) seems to fit this use case best.

When we get a set of lines containing changes from Neovim or Vim we will hash them.
Changing only line 0 and N will result in every line from 0..N being marked as changed.
To avoid performing a diff on such a large sequence of chars we will eliminate moved, deleted and added lines via a custom `Map` type.
We must ensure that no hash collisions have occur by .
Our `Map` keys are the afore mentioned line hashes.
Each hash is associated with references to the two line numbers plus the line `String` that produce the key ensuring hash collisions are handled.
When a set of changed lines includes multiple equal lines we simply distribute them onto the old buffer range.

## WIP


The [diff](https://crates.io/crates/diff), [lcs-diff](https://crates.io/crates/lcs-diff), and [wu-diff](https://crates.io/crates/wu-diff) crates don't implement diff for `Iterator`.
