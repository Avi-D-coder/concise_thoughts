##### <avidessauer@gmail.com>, [github profile](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder)

#### Experience:

*   Platonic Systems full stack Haskell contractor on a Haskell, Nix, Postgres web app.
*   A Tweag Summer 2020 Open Source [Fellow](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-05-fellows-announce/)
*   Frequent open source contributor
*   General knowledge of computer science developed over more than half a decade,\
    of daily self driven education.

#### Technologies:

*   **Haskell**:
    *   Collaborator on [haskell-language-server/haskell-IDE-engine/](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) project, Haskell's only LSP server.
    *   Author of [implicit-hie](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie), used by HLS and Ghcide to remove the need for `hie.yaml` files.
    *   Contributions to dozens of other open source Haskell projects.
    *   Follow GHC proposals & ecosystem developments.

*   **Rust**:
    *   Tweag Fellowship: authored Sundial-GC, a FP focused typed concurrent copying GC.
    *   Contributed to the Rust compiler ([stability annotations on generic parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77118))
    *   Years of experience writing Rust, and following RFCs & ecosystem.

*   **JavaScript/Typescript**: [Improved Node.js readline Unicode handling](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/25723),
    *   Contributions to Coc.nvim the most popular (Neo)Vim LSP Client,
    *   Some frontend web development, mostly backend Nodejs

*   **SQL**: Platonic Systems: Worked on a Haskell PostgreSQL full stack web app.

*   **Linux/Unix**:
    *   Started learning on Ubuntu 12.04,
    *   6 years daily driving Arch Linux
    *   Newly minted NixOS user

*   **Bash**: Significant scripting experience

*   **Python** 2/3: Minimal experience, patching programs, and scripting.

*   **Swift**: pre 3.0, no longer applicable

*   **Competence with all the basics**:\
    Big O, HTML, CSS, Web protocols, Vimscript, debuging, assembly, etc..

#### Significant theoretical/implementation & practical working knowledge of:

*   **Concurrency / Parallelism design approaches**:
    *   **Distributed Systems & Databases**: consensus protocols, ACID,\
        and the trade-offs of alternative consistency guaranties
    *   **High Level**: coroutines, Green threads, actors
    *   **Low level**: Unix threads, C11 atomics, various locks, lock freedom
*   Tracing & concurrent garbage collector development.
